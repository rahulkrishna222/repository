            <div align="justify">Chess is a game played between two opponents on opposite sides of a   board containing 64 squares of alternating colors. Each player has 16   pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns. The   goal of the game is to checkmate the other king. Checkmate happens when   the king is in a position to be captured (in check) and cannot escape   from capture. </div>

               <li>
               <div align="justify">At the beginning of the game the chessboard is laid out so that each   player has the white (or light) color square in the bottom right-hand   side. The chess pieces are then arranged the same way each time. The   second row (or rank) is filled with pawns. The rooks go in the corners,   then the knights next to them, followed by the bishops, and finally the   queen, who always goes on her own matching color (white queen on white,   black queen on black), and the king on the remaining square. 
                              <p>The player with the white pieces always moves first. Therefore,   players generally decide who will get to be white by chance or luck such   as flipping a coin or having one player guess the color of the hidden   pawn in the other player's hand. White then makes a move, followed by   black, then white again, then black and so on until the end of the game. </p>
